# SauceDemo End-to-End Tests
This project contains end-to-end (E2E) tests for the SauceDemo 
website using WebdriverIO and Mocha.  The tests cover the full purchase journey, 
including login, adding items to the cart, checkout, and logout.

## Project Overview
The tests are designed to ensure the core functionality of the SauceDemo website is working 
as expected.  They simulate a user interacting with the site, performing actions like adding 
products to the cart, going through the checkout process, and verifying order confirmation. 
The tests also include resetting the application state and logging out.
